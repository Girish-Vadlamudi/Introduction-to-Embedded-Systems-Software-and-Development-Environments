This is Girish Vadlamudi.
I am doing this project because I am interested and seeking career opperchunities in the field of Embedded Systems. 

In this code I am first printing the given array and then sorting and printing the array.
Finding the Mean, Median, Minimum and Maximum of the array.
Then printing all these stats in a single function.
